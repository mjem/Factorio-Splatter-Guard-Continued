- Iron Man mode, makes you have a weight so high as the train collides that it takes all the damage instead of you. Uses a fair bit of power and 0 recharge.

- Iron Train mode, makes any train you are in have very high weight, power and braking force. So behaves like a normal train, but demolishes anything it hits or hits it. Hight power usage and 0 recharge.

- Ghost Walker mode, trains pass through you. No player hit box when on track. Passive drain.




Use the is placeable over non colliding to make sure it's land
