# Factorio-Splatter-Guard



Stops you being splattered by trains.

If you are in imminent danger of a train hitting you the mod will teleport you a short distance away to a safe spot. It will then hold you in place for a second to avoid you running back into a train.

Should be fully compatible with all other mods.

The mod will have a UPS cost per player as it has to continuously look for dangers in advance. It has been optimised to reduce UPS impact.
